### Source Authentication and Authorization

1. Create a Pocket application: https://getpocket.com/developer/apps/new.
1. Use the app's consumer key to make a request to the `/v3/oauth/request` with ru endpoint to get a `request_token` (`code`).
1. Use the `request_token` to get authorization from the Pocket user: `https://getpocket.com/auth/authorize?request_token=<request_token>&redirect_uri=<redirect_uri>`.
1. Make a request to the `/v3/oauth/authorize` endpoint to get an `access_token`.
1. Put `consumer_key` and `access_token` in a JSON config file.

## Usage

You can easily run `tap-getpocket` by itself or in a pipeline using [Meltano](https://meltano.com/).

### Executing the Tap Directly

```bash
tap-getpocket --version
tap-getpocket --help
tap-getpocket --config CONFIG --discover > ./catalog.json
```

## Developer Resources

### Initialize your Development Environment

```bash
pipx install poetry
poetry install
```

### Create and Run Tests

Create tests within the `tap_pocket/tests` subfolder and
  then run:

```bash
poetry run pytest
```

You can also test the `tap-getpocket` CLI interface directly using `poetry run`:

```bash
poetry run tap-getpocket --help
```

### Testing with [Meltano](https://www.meltano.com)

_**Note:** This tap will work in any Singer environment and does not require Meltano.
Examples here are for convenience and to streamline end-to-end orchestration scenarios._

Next, install Meltano (if you haven't already) and any needed plugins:

```bash
# Install meltano
pipx install meltano
# Initialize meltano within this directory
cd tap-getpocket
meltano install
```

Now you can test and orchestrate using Meltano:

```bash
# Test invocation:
meltano invoke tap-getpocket --version
# OR run a test `elt` pipeline:
meltano elt tap-getpocket target-jsonl
```
